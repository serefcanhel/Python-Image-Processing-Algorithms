# Python-Image-Processing-Algorithms


  ==> This application is designed to simulate different image processing algorithms in python. User needs to start main.py to use  this application. 
  
# Image Process Algorithms

  ==> Blur Image
      --> User needs to enter row and column size for blur image.
  
  ==> Transformation
      --> User can apply Reflection on the X, Y, Both axis. Also, user can apply resize and crop image. 
      
  ==> Conversions
      --> User can apply RGB->HSI, RGB->GRAY, RGB->YIQ, YIQ->RGB, RGB->HSV, HSV->RGB, and RGB->LAB conversions.
      
  ==> Histogram
      --> User can apply Histogram Strecthing, Histogram Equalization, Transfer function, Add/Subtract Intensity properties.
      
  ==> Histogram Graphs
      --> User can see histogram graph of the original image and image processed image. User can see difference of the histogram graphs.
      
  ==> Filtering
      --> User can apply Median filter, Maximum filter, Minimum Filter, and Average Filter. User needs to enter size for filters.
      
  ==> Skeleton
      --> User can clear skeleton image. User can try this image by following steps. 1-) Laplacian Filter 2-) Sharpened Image Filter 3-) Sobel Filter 4-) Sobel Smooth Filter 5-) Mask Image Filter 6-) Image+Mask Filter
   
  ==> High Pass Filtering
      --> User can apply high pass filtering and thresholding.
      
  ==> Moire Pattern
      --> User can apply Moire Pattern to the selected image.
